# GravityRun

I've always been a Batman fan and when I found a guide that had the explanation of traditional side scrollers and explained gravity/score incrementing
of course I had to give it a try. I tried to utilize comments as much as possible to show my mastery of the subject material. What a fun time this one was.
Highly recommend you jump in the code and follow around! 

I have remade this game and different versions, If you are interested in the variations please let me know! Sonic, The Flash, PacMan, etc.
